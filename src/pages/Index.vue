    >Hi! I'm Nick Hanigan from Australia's smallest Capital. I sailed the seas and travelled the outback before beginning an international work career.</p>
    <p
      class="mt-6 sm:mt-8 md:mt-10"
    >I think of myself as a creative, working on some cool things across very different time scales: short, medium and long. Many people know me as the person behind the Hopscotch Wallet & App, a folding case for 2 (two) x mobile phones. That website is over here.</p>

    >I rarely spend time on the socials and only check my personal inbox once every 2 weeks or so. That said, a photo journal that somewhat describes 'me' is here and I am am available to email directly here.</p>

    >Every 12 monthis I intend to send out an insider's guide to my creative year. If I'm busy, I will send it every 6 months, to ensure it is always short and sweet. Enter your email address here to follow those creative adventures.</p>
